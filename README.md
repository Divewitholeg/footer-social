# Responsive and Language Aware Vue 3 Footer

This is a responsive and language aware footer component for Vue 3. Blogging in several languages inevitably brings you to the point where you have a lot of accounts and links to share. Many of these social platforms are language specific or target either a mobile or desktop only audience. This footer component is designed to be responsive and language aware. It will display the appropriate social links and icons based on the language and device type (by screen width).

## Details

The process of creation of this component is described in DETAILS.md.
